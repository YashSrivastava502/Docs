Justify the model choice based on data characteristics


4️⃣ Outputs

Forecast future capacity requirements (next 3–6 months or configurable horizon)

Include confidence intervals if possible

Highlight capacity risk zones (under-utilization / saturation)


5️⃣ Integration

Provide Python code to:

Query the same SQL database

Train the forecasting model

Generate predictions


Suggest how the forecast can be:

Integrated back into the existing Dash dashboard

Displayed as charts and KPIs



Constraints & Notes

Do NOT hardcode schema assumptions — infer everything from the Dash script

Reuse the same data source and logic wherever possible

Code should be modular and production-ready


Once the Dash script is provided, proceed step-by-step and clearly explain each decision.

✅ Tip (optional, but useful)

When you paste the Dash script, add this line before it:

> “Below is the Dash dashboard script. Analyze it carefully before writing any model code.”

If you want, I can also:

Rewrite this prompt in simpler English

Make it more technical / ML-heavy

Customize it for Azure SQL / PostgreSQL / MySQL

Or generate a second prompt specifically for Dash integration


Just tell me 👍
