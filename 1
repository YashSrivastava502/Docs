Interview Explanation
For this workload, the E-series VM is chosen due to its high memory-to-core ratio. Using a 3-year Reserved Instance significantly reduces cost for production workloads while providing the same performance and SLA as Pay-As-You-Go.
Best Practices
- Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Monitor disk utilization to avoid over-provisioning
- Review Azure Advisor recommendations periodically
