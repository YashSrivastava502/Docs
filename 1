When you logged into Kibana, the message "49 of 823 shards failed" meant that some Elasticsearch data shards didn’t respond successfully to Kibana’s query.

It usually happens due to temporary issues like:

Cluster being busy or under load

A node briefly unavailable

Shards being moved or recovered

Query timeout


When you refreshed, the issue disappeared because those shards responded properly the second time. It was likely a short-lived cluster hiccup, not a permanent failure.
