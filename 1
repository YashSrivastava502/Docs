Nice — here’s a clear, actionable cost estimate for 5 × Windows Server 2022 VMs (East US, Pay-As-You-Go) with 4 vCPU / 16 GB RAM each and an external 100 GB managed disk per VM.


---

Summary (monthly, East US, PAYG, ~730 hours/month)

Assumptions

VM size used: closest matching SKU D4as v5 / D4s v3 (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM).

Windows Server license is included in the VM price (License-included VM). 

Disk: Premium SSD managed disk pricing used at ~$0.12/GB-month (Premium SSD v2 typical rate). 

Month = 730 hours.


Per VM estimate

VM (Windows, D4as v5 / D4s v3): ~$259.88 / month (license-included). 

Managed Disk (100 GB Premium SSD): 100 × $0.12 = $12.00 / month. 


Total per VM: $259.88 + $12.00 = $271.88 / month

Total for 5 VMs:
5 × $271.88 = $1,359.40 / month

Notes & Options

If you prefer a cheaper disk (Standard SSD or HDD) the disk cost drops (example: Standard SSD ~ $0.05–0.06/GB → 100 GB ≈ $5–6).

If you plan to run these long-term, Reserved Instances or Savings Plans (1-yr / 3-yr) can reduce VM compute cost significantly — I can calculate 1-yr and 3-yr reserved pricing for you.

If you want me to generate and attach a downloadable CSV or Excel file here, say “Excel please” and I’ll output the file and also paste CSV content (so you can still copy if app download fails).
