lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT


sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mklabel gpt
sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%


sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1


sudo mkdir -p /data


Alright — from your lsblk output:

sdc is your new 20 GB disk (currently no partition or filesystem).

sdb is another disk (16 GB, already mounted at /mnt).

sda is your OS disk (30 GB).


We’ll now partition, format, and mount sdc to /data.


---

1️⃣ Create a partition on /dev/sdc

sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mklabel gpt
sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%


---

2️⃣ Format the partition

After partitioning, the new device will be /dev/sdc1:

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1


---

3️⃣ Create the /data mount point

sudo mkdir -p /data


---

4️⃣ Mount it now

sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /data


---

5️⃣ Make it mount automatically after reboot

Get the UUID:

sudo blkid /dev/sdc1

You’ll see something like:

UUID="abcd-1234-xyz" TYPE="ext4"

Edit /etc/fstab:

sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add:

UUID=abcd-1234-xyz   /data   ext4   defaults   0   2

Save and exit.


---

6️⃣ Verify

df -hT /data

You should see:

/dev/sdc1  ext4   20G   ...   /data





Gotcha — the issue is that the partition /dev/sdc1 never got created.
When you ran parted, it didn’t actually create it successfully (your command seemed typed incorrectly).

Let’s fix this step-by-step:


---

1️⃣ Open parted interactively

sudo parted /dev/sdc


---

2️⃣ Inside parted, run:

mklabel gpt
mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
print
quit

After print, you should see something like:

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      1049kB  20.0GB  20.0GB               primary


---

3️⃣ Verify partition exists

lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT

Now you should see:

sdc     20G
└─sdc1  20G


---

4️⃣ Format the new partition

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1


---

5️⃣ Create mount point

sudo mkdir -p /data


---

6️⃣ Mount it

sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /data


---

7️⃣ Make it persist after reboot

Get UUID:

sudo blkid /dev/sdc1

Edit /etc/fstab:

UUID=<your-uuid> /data ext4 defaults 0 2


---

If you want, I can also combine all of this into a single one-line non-interactive script so you don’t have to do it step-by-step.
Do you want me to give you that?

If you want, next we can move your PostgreSQL data directory from /var/lib/postgresql to /data so this disk is used for DB testing.
That way your main OS disk won’t be touched.

Do you want me to set that up for you?
