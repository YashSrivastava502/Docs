Got it — you want a clean, professional prompt that you can paste into another AI, telling it:

This is the Dash (Python Dash) script used to create a dashboard

The same database (SQL) used by this Dash app should be reused

The data is available from last year (Oct/Nov onwards)

The AI should inspect the schema itself (columns, headings, etc.)

And then build a capacity forecasting model based on that historical data


Here’s a well-structured, copy-paste ready prompt 👇
(You can use this with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.)

📌 Prompt to Paste into Another AI

> I am sharing a Python Dash dashboard script that connects to a SQL database and visualizes operational data.

Your task is to use this Dash script as the source of truth to understand:

Which SQL database is being used

The tables, columns, and metrics queried in the script

The time range of data, which is available from October/November last year onwards


Using the same database and data, I want you to:

1️⃣ Data Understanding

Analyze the SQL queries used in the Dash script

Identify relevant columns such as:

Date / timestamp fields

Capacity, usage, load, volume, or demand-related metrics

Any categorical dimensions (service, region, team, system, etc.)


Infer the schema directly from the script (do not assume column names)


2️⃣ Data Preparation

Propose how to clean and aggregate the historical data

Handle missing values, seasonality, trends, and outliers

Define the correct time granularity (daily / weekly / monthly) for forecasting


3️⃣ Capacity Forecasting Model

Build a capacity forecasting model using the historical data

Choose appropriate models such as:

Time-series models (ARIMA / SARIMA / Prophet)

ML models (XGBoost / RandomForest / LSTM if suitable)


Justify the model choice based on data characteristics


4️⃣ Outputs

Forecast future capacity requirements (next 3–6 months or configurable horizon)

Include confidence intervals if possible

Highlight capacity risk zones (under-utilization / saturation)


5️⃣ Integration

Provide Python code to:

Query the same SQL database

Train the forecasting model

Generate predictions


Suggest how the forecast can be:

Integrated back into the existing Dash dashboard

Displayed as charts and KPIs



Constraints & Notes

Do NOT hardcode schema assumptions — infer everything from the Dash script

Reuse the same data source and logic wherever possible

Code should be modular and production-ready


Once the Dash script is provided, proceed step-by-step and clearly explain each decision.

✅ Tip (optional, but useful)

When you paste the Dash script, add this line before it:

> “Below is the Dash dashboard script. Analyze it carefully before writing any model code.”

If you want, I can also:

Rewrite this prompt in simpler English

Make it more technical / ML-heavy

Customize it for Azure SQL / PostgreSQL / MySQL

Or generate a second prompt specifically for Dash integration


Just tell me 👍
