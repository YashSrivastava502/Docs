Good — here are clear, sourced costs for 60 protected VMs in Azure Site Recovery (ASR) and 70 Standard static IPv4 addresses in East US (monthly).


---

1) Azure Site Recovery — 60 protected instances (monthly)

Important note: ASR pricing depends on the target and Microsoft’s published tiers:

ASR → Azure (replicating to Azure): $25.00 per protected instance / month. 

ASR → customer-owned site (on-prem): $16.00 per protected instance / month. 


Also: the first 31 days of protection for any newly protected instance are free. Storage used to hold replicated data, storage transactions and egress are billed separately. 

Monthly cost (60 instances):

If replicating to Azure: 60 × $25 = $1,500.00 / month. 

If replicating to customer-owned site: 60 × $16 = $960.00 / month. 


Notes: these are the ASR service license charges only. You must also account for:

Azure storage consumed by the replicas (managed disks or blob storage)

Storage transactions (for replication) and snapshot costs

Egress charges (if applicable)
I can estimate these too if you provide average protected data per VM (GB) and RPO/RTO settings.

2) Standard Static Public IPv4 — 70 addresses (monthly)

Microsoft’s Standard public IPv4 addresses are charged hourly. The commonly used rate (Standard Static IPv4) is $0.005 per IP per hour (Standard SKU). 

Assuming 730 hours/month:

Cost per IP / month = 0.005 × 730 = $3.65

70 IPs / month = 70 × $3.65 = $255.50


So: ~$255.50 / month for 70 Standard static IPv4 addresses. 

Notes:

Charges apply even if an IP is reserved but unattached (check specifics for attached/unattached cases). 

If you need Public IP Prefix (blocks), pricing differs and you may be charged per-IP in the prefix as soon as the prefix is created.

Total summary (monthly)

Item	Unit price	Qty	Monthly cost

ASR → Azure (protected instance)	$25.00	60	$1,500.00
ASR → Customer-owned (protected instance)	$16.00	60	$960.00
Standard Static Public IPv4	$0.005 / hr (~$3.65/mo)	70	$255.50


If you choose ASR → Azure + 70 IPs: $1,500.00 + $255.50 = $1,755.50 / month.

If you choose ASR → customer site + 70 IPs: $960.00 + $255.50 = $1,215.50 / month.

If you want I can:

Estimate replication storage costs (need average protected GB per VM).

Produce an Excel file with this breakdown (I’ll paste CSV too so you can save it in the app).

Calculate costs using a different hourly-month assumption (e.g., 730 vs 720).


Which of those would you like next?
