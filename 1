This Week:

1. Concluded the Application Insights automation using the Playwright library; determined that it does not work as expected compared to Selenium.


2. Destroyed unused/test infrastructure in the DR resource group to optimize resources.


3. Created a new domain controller fptest.local and its replica for testing purposes in the DR environment.


4. Tested all use cases of the domain controller, including failover and fallback scenarios.


5. Documented all the steps involved in the Domain Controller setup/configuration POC.



Next Week:
