Here’s the cost estimate for 5 VMs, each with 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, and an external 100 GB disk (assuming Premium SSD) in East US, Ubuntu Linux (PAYG):

Cost Breakdown

1. VM Compute – 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM

The closest matching SKU (D4as v5 or D4s v5) costs approximately $0.171–$0.192 per hour, which translates to:

Hourly: ~$0.171–0.192

Monthly (~730 hours): $124.8 to $140.2
— e.g., D4as v5: $141.62/month 


2. Premium SSD (100 GB)

Premium SSD disk pricing (P10/P20) generally ranges between:

$0.12–$0.15 per GB per month → Estimated: $12–$15 per 100 GB
From pricing data (e.g., P30 1 TB at ~$122.88/month) 
Or derive as ~$0.143/GB using interpolation (512 GB disk at $73.22/month)

Notes & Clarifications

VM cost range reflects pricing variability between $0.171/hr (74.4$/mo) and $0.192/hr (140$/mo); we used the more recent D4as v5 price (~141$/mo) .

The disk cost is estimated using interpolation or typical Premium SSD tiers; actual pricing depends on specific SKU and region.

Does not include: bandwidth, snapshots, OS license, or managed backups.

You can potentially reduce costs with Reserved Instance or Spot pricing.
