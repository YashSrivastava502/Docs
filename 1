I have consistently exceeded expectations by driving key initiatives that strengthened team efficiency and operational standards. In the DR Automation project, I implemented Infrastructure as Code to streamline recovery, reducing manual effort and downtime. Through Network Automation, I enabled real-time monitoring and dynamic policy updates, improving compliance and reducing risks. I also contributed to Observability Automation, where I automated monitoring setups and alerting across environments, ensuring faster issue detection and resolution. Additionally, I delivered a Contact Center Dashboard to provide real-time performance insights, helping teams make data-driven decisions. I proactively share knowledge, suggest improvements, and go beyond my core role to support team goals.
