Azure Production Cost Estimation – Interview Ready
Scenario:
Azure Production environment in East US region with three virtual machines.


Infrastructure Requirement
- Number of VMs: 3
- Per VM Configuration:
  • CPU: 32 vCPUs
  • RAM: 128 GB
  • Disk: 1 TB Premium SSD (/data)
- OS: Linux


Recommended Azure VM Size
Standard_D32s_v5
- 32 vCPUs
- 128 GB RAM
- Best suited for balanced compute and memory workloads in production

~37%
3-Year Reserved
$2,205
$26,460
~58%

Interview Explanation (How to Answer)
In production, I prefer Reserved Instances for predictable workloads. For this setup, a 3-year Reserved Instance gives the best cost optimization, reducing costs by nearly 60% compared to Pay-As-You-Go while maintaining full performance. Premium SSDs are used to ensure consistent IOPS and low latency for production workloads.
FinOps & Architecture Best Practices
- Use 3-Year Reserved Instances for stable PROD workloads
- Enable Availability Zones for high availability (no extra VM cost)
- Monitor Log Analytics ingestion to avoid unexpected costs
- Right-size VMs periodically using Azure Advisor
