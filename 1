Standard Load Balancer Pricing (East US)

First 5 rules: $0.025 per hour → roughly $18.25/month (assuming ~730 hours)


Additional rules: Typically $0.01 per rule per hour, which means $7.30 per rule per month


Data processed: Charged at $0.005 per GB

Example Scenarios

Scenario	Est. Monthly Cost

Minimal config (≤5 rules, minimal data)	~$18.25 (base rules) + data charges
Add one extra rule	~$18.25 + $7.30 = ~$25.55
Heavy data throughput (e.g. 10 GB processed)	~$18.25 + (10 GB × $0.005) = ~$18.30


So, if you're only using up to 5 rules, expect around $18/month base. Each additional rule adds about $7/month, plus data processing at $0.005/GB.
