Got it — your parted run failed because you typed mkpart primary ext4 0% 100% while it was still asking for "Yes/No" confirmation.
Let’s do it cleanly from scratch.


---

Step-by-step to partition, format, and mount /dev/sdc

1️⃣ Check your disk

lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT

You should see /dev/sdc with 20G and no partitions.


---

2️⃣ Create a new GPT partition table

sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mklabel gpt


---

3️⃣ Create a primary partition spanning the whole disk

sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%


---

4️⃣ Verify the partition

lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT

You should now see:

sdc     20G
└─sdc1  20G


---

5️⃣ Format the partition as ext4

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1


---

6️⃣ Create a mount point

sudo mkdir -p /data


---

7️⃣ Mount it

sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /data


---

8️⃣ Verify

df -hT /data

Expected:

/dev/sdc1  ext4   20G   ...   /data


---

9️⃣ Make it permanent after reboot Get the UUID:

sudo blkid /dev/sdc1

Edit /etc/fstab:

sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add this line:

UUID=<your-uuid-here>   /data   ext4   defaults   0   2

Save and exit (CTRL+O, ENTER, CTRL+X).


---

If you want, I can now give you PostgreSQL steps to move the data directory to /data so your DB actually uses this new disk for testing.
That way, nothing touches the OS disk.

Do you want me to give you that next?
