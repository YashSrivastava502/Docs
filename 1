Alright. I’ll write this cleanly, clearly, and correctly, so you can use it as project documentation / design note / interview explanation.

No code.
No assumptions.
Just your requirement and the tables we created/used.

📌 YOUR REQUIREMENT (AS FINALLY AGREED)

1️⃣ Business Problem

You want a capacity management dashboard that can answer this question at any time:

> “What is the current capacity (CPU, RAM, Storage) right now?”



The challenge is:

Inventory comes weekly

Capacity changes happen daily

You must not modify inventory daily

You must still show accurate current capacity



---

2️⃣ Core Concept

You designed the system with three layers:

🔹 Inventory (Baseline)

Comes weekly

Represents the starting point

Is never modified by daily operations


🔹 Daily Changes (Events)

Allocate / Deallocate happens daily

Can affect:

CPU

RAM

Storage

One or all at the same time


Can be:

Manual (dashboard entry)

Automatic (CSV picked daily at fixed time, e.g. 10 PM IST)



🔹 Snapshot (Calculated Truth)

Represents current used capacity

Calculated from:

Baseline + All Events

Used by dashboard for fast and stable KPIs



---

3️⃣ What the Dashboard Must Do

Dashboard should show:

✅ KPI Cards

For Storage, RAM, CPU:

Total capacity (given by you)

Used capacity (from snapshot)

Free capacity

% Used

Visual alert when usage crosses threshold (e.g. 75%)


✅ Capacity Trend

Trend graph based on daily events

Resource selector:

Storage / RAM / CPU



✅ Recent Events

Table showing:

Date & time

Server

Resource

Allocate / Deallocate

Value

Source (Manual / CSV)


Date filter



---

4️⃣ How Data Enters the System

Manual

User enters allocate / deallocate from dashboard

Writes data to events table only


Automatic (CSV)

CSV placed in a folder

Picked automatically at fixed time

Same structure as manual

Writes data to events table only


👉 Manual and CSV both follow the same pipeline


---

5️⃣ Important Rules (Very Important)

❌ Inventory is never modified by allocation/deallocation

❌ Dashboard never writes to inventory

✅ All daily changes go to events

✅ Snapshot is the single source of truth for “current state”

✅ Dashboard only reads data



---

📊 TABLES USED IN THIS PROJECT

These tables were created after our project discussion and are used for the capacity dashboard layer.


---

1️⃣ server_capacity_master

Purpose

Stores total configured capacity

Example:

Total Storage

Total RAM

Total CPU


Can also store reserved percentage (e.g. 30%)


Role

Read by dashboard

Not updated frequently

Configuration-level table



---

2️⃣ server_capacity_events

Purpose

Stores daily capacity changes

This is the most important table


What it contains

Server name

Resource type (CPU / RAM / Storage)

Allocate or Deallocate

Change value (+ / −)

Source:

Manual

CSV


Reason

Timestamp


Role

Audit trail

Trend calculation

Input for snapshot calculation



---

3️⃣ server_capacity_snapshot

Purpose

Stores calculated capacity state

Represents:

> “Current used capacity at this point in time”




What it contains

Used storage

Used RAM

Used CPU

Snapshot timestamp


Role

Drives KPI cards

Makes dashboard fast and reliable

Avoids recalculating everything on every page load



---

6️⃣ Final Architecture Summary

Weekly Inventory (Baseline)
        ↓
(server_capacity_snapshot seeded once)

Daily Allocate / Deallocate
(Manual UI / CSV Auto Pickup)
        ↓
server_capacity_events
        ↓
Recalculation Job
        ↓
server_capacity_snapshot
        ↓
Dashboard (KPIs, Trend, Events)


---

7️⃣ One-Line Summary (Interview Ready)

> “We treat inventory as a weekly baseline, track all daily capacity changes as events, compute snapshots for the current state, and use a dashboard to visualize real-time capacity without ever modifying the inventory.”

If you want, next I can:

Convert this into official project documentation

Convert this into interview explanation

Or map this to real-world CMDB / capacity tools


Just tell me what you want next.
