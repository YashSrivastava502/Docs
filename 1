East US (US East), 1-month (~730 hrs) price check for each Azure item. Where you didn’t specify a tier/sku, I’ve noted assumptions and ranges.

1. Internal Load Balancer – Basic (ILB Basic)



~$0/month (Basic Load Balancer is free). Note: Basic LB is retiring Sept 30, 2025; plan to move to Standard. 


2. FortiGate Firewall (4 vCPU, 2 NICs)



BYOL: $0/hr Azure software fee (you supply the Fortinet license). You’ll still pay for the VM compute, disks, IPs, bandwidth. 

PAYG (Marketplace): $1.02/hr software fee ⇒ ~$744.60/month for the software + Azure VM compute, disks, IPs, bandwidth. (Price shown for the 4 vCPU PAYG plan.) 


3. Azure Compute Gallery (formerly Shared Image Gallery)



Gallery service itself: $0. You pay for underlying storage (managed images/snapshots), replication, and egress only. 


4. Blob Storage – 1.5 TB



Pricing depends on access tier and redundancy. As a ballpark for LRS in East US:

Hot tier: $28–$31/month** for 1.5 TB (excludes transactions/egress). 

Cool tier: $15–$16/month** (plus higher read/early-deletion fees). 

(Exact $/GB varies by region and redundancy; use the official calculator for a precise quote.) 



5. Azure Site Recovery (ASR) – 12 protected VMs



$25 per protected instance / month (after the first 31 days of replication for that VM).

Estimate: 12 × $25 = $300/month for protection fees. Storage/IO/egress for replication is extra. 



6. 100 Public IP addresses (Standard, static IPv4)



~$0.005 per IP per hour ⇒ ~$3.65 per IP per month ⇒ ~$365/month for 100 IPs. (Standard SKU recommended; Basic pricing differs.) 


7. 3 Virtual Networks (VNets)



$0 for the VNet resources themselves. You may incur charges for peering, gateways, private endpoints, data processing/egress if used. 


8. Azure Front Door (global L7 load balancer)



Base fee per profile (billed hourly):

Standard: $35/month

Premium: $330/month


Plus usage: egress from edge to clients, requests (per 10k), and (in some cases) edge→origin egress. Data from Azure origin to Front Door Standard/Premium is free.

Quick notes & assumptions

Month assumed as 730 hours.

Region-specific prices may vary slightly by currency/program; for an exact quote against your subscription, plug these into the Azure Pricing Calculator and select East US. 


If you want, tell me your intended Blob tier (Hot/Cool/Archive) + redundancy (LRS/ZRS/GRS) and Front Door tier + rough traffic and I’ll compute a tighter estimate with line items.
